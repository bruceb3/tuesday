# Tuesday



ctrl-o and ctrl-i move the cursor back and forth between jump points in files.

Tuesday aims to provide the same feature except to track the entire of state of vim, at least as much as is stored in via the mksession and session commands.

Before loading a new file, a session is saved.
Before completing a split of window, a session is saved.
Before exiting vim, a session is saved.
Before creating or deleteing a tab, a session is saved.
